# EIPs Documentation: Empowering Developers in the Ethereum Ecosystem.

## What Is an EIP

EIPs(Ethereum Improvement Proposals) are design documents that provide information to the Ethereum community or describe new features or processes for the Ethereum network.

## What are ERCs and How to Interact with Them

### ERC-20: The Token Standard

[Ethereum Request for Comments 20 (ERC-20)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) is a widely adopted standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum network. ERC-20 tokens power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling seamless transfer and management of various assets. In this section, we'll dive into the core concepts of ERC-20 tokens and provide practical examples of how to interact with them using smart contracts. Lets see how to [Interact with ERC20](./ERC20.md).

### ERC-721: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

[Ethereum Request for Comments 721 (ERC-721)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) introduced the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These unique tokens have revolutionized digital ownership, enabling creators to tokenize and sell one-of-a-kind digital assets. We'll explore the world of ERC-721 tokens, including how to create, transfer, and manage NFTs.Lets see how to [Interact with ERC721](./ERC721.md).

### ERC-1271: Standardized Smart Contract Signatures

[Ethereum Request for Comments 1271 (ERC-1271)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) defines a standardized way to perform smart contract signatures. This EIP is crucial for secure interactions on the Ethereum network, particularly for validating messages and transactions. In this section, we'll cover the importance of ERC-1271 and provide code examples to integrate this standard into your applications.
