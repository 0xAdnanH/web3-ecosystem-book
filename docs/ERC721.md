# ERC721: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

ERC-721 tokens have revolutionized the concept of digital ownership by enabling the creation and trade of unique, indivisible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Understanding ERC-721 Tokens (NFTs)

ERC-721 tokens are a type of token standard on the Ethereum blockchain that represent ownership of a unique digital item. Unlike ERC-20 tokens (which are fungible and interchangeable), each ERC-721 token has distinct characteristics, making them ideal for representing one-of-a-kind assets such as digital art, collectibles, in-game items, and more.

Key features of ERC-721 tokens include:

1. Unique Identification: Each ERC-721 token has a unique identifier, making it distinguishable from other tokens in the same contract.

2. Indivisibility: ERC-721 tokens are indivisible; you can't split them into smaller units like you can with ERC-20 tokens.

3. Ownership Transfer: ERC-721 tokens allow the transfer of ownership from one Ethereum address to another, facilitating the buying, selling, and trading of unique digital assets.

4. Metadata: ERC-721 tokens often include metadata that describes the attributes of the token, such as its name, image, description, and other relevant information.

## Interacting with ERC-721 Tokens (NFTs) in Smart Contracts

To interact with ERC-721 tokens within a smart contract, you typically need to perform the following actions:

1. Import the ERC-721 Interface: Include the ERC-721 interface in your smart contract. The interface defines the standard functions that an ERC-721 token contract must implement.

2. Instantiate the Token Contract: Create an instance of the ERC-721 token contract using the token's address.

3. Use Standard Functions: Utilize the standard ERC-721 functions, such as mint, transferFrom, balanceOf, and tokenURI, to perform actions like creating new tokens, transferring ownership, checking balances, and accessing token metadata.

Here's a simple example in Solidity demonstrating how to check the owner of an ERC-721 token and retrieve its metadata:

```
// Import the ERC-721 interface
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol";

contract NFTInfo {
    // Address of the ERC-721 token
    address public tokenAddress;

    constructor(address _tokenAddress) {
        tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
    }

    // Function to check the owner of a specific token
    function getOwner(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address) {
        // Create an instance of the ERC-721 token contract
        IERC721 token = IERC721(tokenAddress);

        // Use the ownerOf function to get the owner's address
        return token.ownerOf(_tokenId);
    }

    // Function to get the metadata URI of a specific token
    function getTokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (string memory) {
        // Create an instance of the ERC-721 token contract
        IERC721 token = IERC721(tokenAddress);

        // Use the tokenURI function to get the metadata URI
        return token.tokenURI(_tokenId);
    }
}

```

In this example, we have a smart contract called NFTInfo that allows you to check the owner of a specific ERC-721 token and retrieve its metadata URI. You'll need to replace the @openzeppelin/contracts import with the appropriate package version, compile, and deploy the contract using a development environment like Remix or Hardhat.

Remember that this is a basic example, and there are many other functionalities you can implement when working with ERC-721 tokens, such as creating new tokens, handling events, and integrating NFTs into your DApps.

Understanding these core concepts and examples will empower developers to effectively work with ERC-721 tokens and incorporate them into their decentralized applications..

## Interacting with ERC721 using ethers.js

Interacting with any contract applies mainly the same steps as mentioned in [Interacting with ERC20 Token using ethers.js](./ERC20.md)
